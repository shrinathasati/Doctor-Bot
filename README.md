# Doctor-Bot
Doctor Bot is a machine learning project. It has been trained with accurate and large dataset which can predict any Disease based on your symptoms. It also suggest some precaution which should be take.
I have used Scikit-learn, Pandas, numpy and some other library of python. I have trained our model using DecisionTreeClassifier and SVM algorithms. Model has trained with Training.csv and accuracy has checked with Testing.csv.
